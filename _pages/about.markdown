Project description
===================

[Goquadro][goquadro] is a web-based, workflow-aware cloud storage system.

The web interface to Goquadro is provided by a single-page application built with **AngularJS** alongside with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
The [secure connection][qualys-test] to the servers is powered by **nginx** in a **forward-security**-compliant **HSTS** mode. Goquadro servers are fully [IPv6 compliant](http://ipv6-test.com/validate.php?url=www.goquadro.com).  
Cookieless authentication is performed using **JSON web tokens** and persisted through HTML5 **web storage**.  
The api server is written in **Go** and serves data to the application through a **RESTful** interface.  
User passwords are stored using a **bcrypt** implementation.  
Application data is stored in a **MongoDB** database, whereas user files are stored on Amazon S3.  
Goquadro sends emails (for account verification and for user notification) using the [Mailgun][mailgun] API.  
Goquadro sits on a dedicated infrastructure, managed via **ssh** and monitored using [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com).  
Basic interaction with Goquadro is provided through the dedicated [Google Chrome extension](http://bit.ly/gqchromeext), which lets the user push to Goquadro a reference to webpages or remote files with a single click.

All the code was written using SublimeText3 and VIM, versioned using **git** and saved on a GitLab instance installed on a virtual private server.
